# UiPath TypeScript Coded-App Rules

Use these rules when `@Sites` output must be deployable as a UiPath coded app.

## Core constraints

- UiPath coded apps are static browser apps, not Cloudflare Worker deployments.
- `uipath.json` is the primary coded-app config file.
- Local development should use `@uipath/coded-apps-dev`.
- The runtime deployment target is the UiPath ecosystem, not Sites hosting.
- Sites is only the prompt entry point for these requests; do not use its starter, storage, auth, hosting, or Worker output assumptions.

## Required implementation details

- Use Vite + React unless the user explicitly wants another static framework.
- Set `base: './'` in Vite config.
- Keep asset references relative.
- Use `getAppBase()` when a router needs a basename.
- Use `@uipath/uipath-typescript` for SDK access.
- Keep `uipath.json` at project root with client and scope settings.

## Canonical publish flow

```bash
# use the official uipath-coded-apps skill for the operational flow
npm run build
uip codedapp pack dist -n <app-name> --version <version> --content-type webapp
uip codedapp publish --name <app-name> --version <version> --type Web
uip codedapp deploy --name <app-name> --version <version>
```

## Explicit prohibition

For these requests, do not hand the final deployment to normal Sites hosting unless the user explicitly requests dual deployment.

## Local verification

Follow the official `uipath-coded-apps` skill for local verification before packaging and deployment.
